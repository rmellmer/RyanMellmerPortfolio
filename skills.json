            "description": "I recently began leading a team of software developers at Portland State University tasked with creating a C++ library which runs on a tiny DAC to produce realistic instrument sounds via a process called Wavetable Synthesis. This library will be able to take a recorded sample of an actual instrument, and perform various transformations on them to generate different high-quality samples representing different pitches. The idea is that a micro-controller (with very limited on-board memory) will be able to be used as an instrument! The idea is to allow this library to be included in an Arduino project to run not only on this particular DAC we are targeting, but to also allow it to be used in any Arduino-based micro-controller. Stay tuned for more updates as we implement this unique library!",
